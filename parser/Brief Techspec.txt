Technical Specification Brief

Input: 2D Array of cells representing a spreadsheet, where each cell represents
       a JSON value

Output: A set of vectors of type JSONObject, where each vector represents a
        table contained within the cells.
        Each JSONObject represents a row of values in the table; it contains a
        name-value pair for each column, where:
          name is equal to the column header
          value is equal to the corresponding value in the row
          
For the purposes of rapidly achieving a working prototype, some elements of the
process may be given a simple definition, but would ideally have a more complex
definition:

  A table may be simply defined as:
    A horizontal row of strings with unique values
    One or more rows of the same width directly beneath containing
    non-null values
  A more complex definition would allow for:
    Gaps in between columns/rows
    Null values in certain fields
    Cross-referencing with other tables
    Identity-checking based on semantics to distinguish between actual tables
    containing meaningful data and random values which coincidentally match the
    simple definition
    
  A boolean may be simply defined as:
    A string with the value "true" or "false"
  A more complex definition would allow for:
    Various alternative words or phrases for a boolean value
    Semantic checking to confirm whether a value is actually boolean based on
    the other values in the table with the same name
    
  A number may be simply defined as:
    A value exactly matching the JSON definition of a number
  A more complex definition would allow for:
    Spelled-out numbers
    Semantic checking to confirm whether a value is intended as numerical based
    on the other values in the table with the same name
