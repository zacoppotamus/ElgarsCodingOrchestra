Note: A defendant with more than one type of violation appears in more than,,,,,,,,
one column. A defendant with more than one of the same type of violation,,,,,,,,
"appears only once in that column. Therefore, the sum of individual violations",,,,,,,,
exceeds the total. Not all violations resulted in revocation.,,,,,,,,
*Data describe defendants whose pretrial services were terminated,,,,,,,,
"in 1995, and exclude defendants who were released but whose",,,,,,,,
records did not contain sufficient information to determine type of,,,,,,,,
release or violation behavior.,,,,,,,,
... No case of this type occurred in the data.,,,,,,,,
