By jove I've got it! A probability measure!
Increase the probability based on any number of factors, ranging from the
obvious (consecutive strings) to the obscure (rows of strings at different heights)
Various other factors may decrease the probability, such as blank squares in
the table, or inconsistent field types in a column
