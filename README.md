Elgar's Coding Orchestra
=====================

Our totally unnamed project is still pretty sparse. We currently have a server set up at spe.sneeza.me, and all members of our group have an account on that server with sudo access. Your default password will be 'password' which you can change by running the passwd command.

Project Page
---------------------

We currently have a public facing website located at:

```
http://project.spe.sneeza.me/
```

Our API
---------------------

You can find detailed documentation about how to use the API on [Mashape](https://www.mashape.com/sneeza/project-rainhawk#!documentation). The API is free to use while it's still in active pre-release development. Mashape have many wrappers for different languages which can be used to make calls to the API using an authorization key, so they'll help you get started.

We are currently in the process of developing more complex and native wrapper classes for different languages, to interface with the API directly and take care of all the error handling for you. Please check back here for more info in the near future.
