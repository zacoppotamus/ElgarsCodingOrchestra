New logic for our application
---

This here is going to be the new logic for the frontend part of our project, using AngularJS.

Even though its use is not needed as much in other sections of the website it is almost mandatory in the 'custom visualizations' part of the project and would greatly benefit the modularity of our application if it were also used when editing datasets (if we have time).


Dependencies
----

To get dependencies run ```bower install```.


To-Do
----

* The most important thing: Generating a visualization, maybe in the same, maybe in a different page.
* Write a gruntfile/makefile for this and then the whole frontend.
* Think of how to implement limitations in the data fields.
* Refactor!

PS
----

I know I broke the guidelines (several of them), but I couldn't think of another way to show how the app is going to be structured from now on without putting it in a separate folder! js/,img/,css/ is so 2010 :P.
